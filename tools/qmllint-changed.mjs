// Lint every QML file changed in the working tree, filtering qmllint's false
// positives.
//
// Why this exists: qmllint cannot parse optional chaining (`?.`) or nullish
// coalescing (`??`) -- it flags even a three-line file using them with
// "Unexpected token `.`". This project uses both across pre-existing, working
// shell code, so a raw `qmllint` sweep produces mostly noise, and the noise
// makes it easy to miss a genuine error sitting in the middle of it.
//
// That is exactly what happened: a mangled line
//     ColorScheme.color("error", dark) : Qt.rgba(0.73, 0.10, 0.12, 1))
// sat in AppearanceTokens.qml and only surfaced when QuickShell refused to
// load. The linter had flagged it; it was buried among ~40 `?.` reports.
//
// This script reports only errors whose preceding lines contain neither `?.`
// nor `??`, then prints the offending source line so it can be judged.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/qmllint-changed.mjs          # changed files only
//   node tools/qmllint-changed.mjs --all    # every .qml in shell/ shared/ apps/

// Optional chaining / nullish coalescing: qmllint misparses these.
//
// The window is deliberately wide (and biased backwards). qmllint does not
// report an error ON the `?.` line -- it loses sync and then emits a cascade
// of bogus "Unexpected token" errors on the lines that FOLLOW, sometimes many
// lines later. A real example: `implicitWidth: screen?.width ?? 1920` at line
// 35 produced errors at 35, 36 and again at 41 ("Expected token `:'"). A
// 4-line lookback reported line 41 as a genuine fault; 12 lines back plus 2
// forward is what it actually takes to attribute the cascade to its cause.

    // One consequence worth knowing before trusting the output: with the

    // only "error" is a construct qmllint cannot parse without qmltypes --
    // `pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound` and typed functions such as
    // `function show(): void {}`. Both are valid Qt 6 QML, and the same silence
    // happens whenever the sandbox denies qmllint its system imports (it then
