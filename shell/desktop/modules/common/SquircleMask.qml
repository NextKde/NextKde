// Most surfaces no longer write this by hand: LiquidGlassPanel applies the mask
// to its own subtree and forwards the outline, so all a caller needs there is a
// cornerExponent above 2. What is left here are surfaces that own their fill --
// the lock screen's notification card is the only remaining caller.
//
// The field is the same implicit function as Squircle.mjs, and the same one the
// compositor masks glass with for a surface that declares its shape through
// kos-surface-shape-v1, so the content edge and the glass edge describe one
// outline instead of two.
//
// The host has to hand over two things it cannot keep:
//
//   - Children must render unrounded (radius 0). Rounding them as well as the
//     mask rounds the surface twice.
//   - Rectangle.border cannot be used. A straight border is cut off wherever
//     the mask's corner arc departs from the rectangle edge, so pass the
//     outline through borderWidth / borderColor and this shader draws it along
//     the same field, corners included.
//
// Anti-aliasing is the compositor's own footprint (1 - clamp(0.5 +
// f / fwidth(f))). Because that is a ratio it normalises away the field's
// gradient length, so the ramp stays one pixel wide across a straight edge and
// sqrt(2) pixels at 45 degrees for every exponent -- raising the exponent costs
// nothing in edge quality, and there is no tessellated path to facet. That is
// the whole reason to shape with an SDF rather than a ShapePath; see
// test_squircle.mjs, which measures the ramp.
//
// Painted by shaders/squircle.frag. Keep it in sync with Squircle.mjs.
