// show the darkening through itself and read grey, worst along its own edge --
// which also rules out DropShadow and MultiEffect.shadowEnabled: both composite
// their shadow below the source by construction, with no way to subtract the
// source from it.
//
// Painted by shaders/card_shadow.frag, which evaluates the same superelliptical
// field as SquircleMask, so the card's edge and the shadow's hole describe one
// curve rather than two that agree only by convention.
