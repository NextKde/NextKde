# Network status architecture

`shell/desktop/modules/bar/NetworkService.qml` is the presentation adapter between
shell UI and the `network.*` operations exposed by `kos-platform`. The C++
platform module reads NetworkManager state and connects profiles through its
native D-Bus API, and uses `nmcli` for scanning, radio changes, disconnection
and profile removal. It returns a normalized JSON object. No QML component invokes `nmcli` or parses its output.

## Public state contract

Consumers use these properties:

- `available`: whether NetworkManager could be queried.
- `networkingEnabled`, `wifiEnabled`: global radio state.
- `connectionType`: `wifi`, `ethernet`, or `none`.
- `deviceState`: `connected`, `connecting`, `disconnected`, `disabled`, or
  `unknown`.
- `connectivity`: `full`, `portal`, `limited`, `none`, or `unknown`.
- `deviceName`, `connectionName`, `ssid`, `signalStrength`, `ipv4`.
- `wifiDeviceName`: the wireless interface's ifname, reported even when the
  selected device is ethernet (or nothing is connected). Scan requests must
  use this name; `deviceName` only tracks the device carrying connectivity.

`deviceState` means a link/profile state. `connectivity` is the independent
NetworkManager Internet reachability check; UI must preserve that distinction.
For example, a connected Wi-Fi device with `limited` connectivity receives an
orange warning badge instead of an offline icon.

## UI ownership

- `NetworkStatus.qml` renders the passive Bar indicator and hover details.
- `NetworkService.qml` requests the active interface's RX/TX counters through
  `network.traffic` and derives shared transfer rates once per second while
  connected. `NetworkTraffic.qml` only formats that snapshot; tooltips and
  panels reuse the same samples.
- `NetworkPanel.qml` renders the Wi-Fi picker popup that the Bar and the
  control centre's Wi-Fi card both open for scan/connect/disconnect actions.
- `BarWindow.qml` only places the component.
- Control-centre and picker UI consume `NetworkService` rather than
  duplicating state logic.

## Write API

`connectWifi(ssid, password, savedProfileUuid)` connects normal WPA/open
networks and can reactivate a known profile without asking for its password
again. Enterprise networks use `connectEnterpriseWifi(ssid, identity,
password, eapMethod, anonymousIdentity)`;
currently the explicit supported choices are PEAP/MSCHAPv2 and TTLS/PAP. The
service exposes `wifiConnectInProgress`, `wifiConnectError`, and
`wifiConnectionFinished` for all UI surfaces. Connection credentials are sent
to NetworkManager in typed D-Bus settings, rather than command-line arguments.
QML does not persist them; NetworkManager owns saved profile credentials. The enterprise method
creates only a shell-owned `quickshell-8021x-…` NetworkManager profile, so it
does not overwrite an unrelated profile with the same SSID.

TLS and CA-certificate policy remain a follow-up because they need a certificate
picker and must not be guessed. `setWifiEnabled(enabled)` is the radio write
method used by the Wi-Fi panel. `disconnectActiveWifi()` intentionally removes
only the active device connection and preserves its saved NetworkManager
profile. `forgetWifiProfile(ssid, profileUuid)` deletes only the UUID resolved
from the selected scan row, after the panel's explicit confirmation.

`refreshWifiNetworks()` returns de-duplicated nearby SSIDs (the strongest AP per
name) only when the user opens the panel. When NetworkManager's saved profile
name matches the SSID (its default), the candidate also carries that profile's
UUID for reconnect/forget actions. Saved-profile metadata is best-effort and
must never prevent the nearby-network list from loading.
