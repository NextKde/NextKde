// `maximized` selects the green light's mark and is ignored by the other two: a
// window that is maximized offers to restore, so the mark is what clicking the

// Deliberately free of KWin headers, like panelgeometry.h and windowrules.h.
// The mark inside a light is pure QPainter geometry over a rectangle, and being
// able to draw it without a compositor is the point of it being a unit of its
// own: preview/glyph_preview.cpp renders these lights to a PNG in about a
// second, with no effect to build, install, or restart a compositor for. That
// loop is the reason the code lives here rather than inline in buildPanel() --
// a mark that can only be looked at by installing the effect is a mark that
// gets tuned blind.
