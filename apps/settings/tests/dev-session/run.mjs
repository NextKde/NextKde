// Which QML tree the Settings window runs is decided by the session it serves,

//
//   * a Shell started from a checkout (`kosctl dev` -> `qs -p <checkout>/shell`)
//     must make the window load that checkout's own pages. The binary is the
//     installed one in that mode -- `dev` builds no apps -- so without this the
//     window would silently show the installed copy and QML edits would need a
//     `kosctl install` each time, which is the whole thing `dev` exists to avoid;
//   * an ordinary launch must keep loading the copy beside the binary, and must
//     not watch it: that copy is a destination, not an edit surface.
//
// Choosing wrong is invisible: every candidate renders the same UI, so the only
// evidence is the line the binary logs while choosing. That line is what this
// asserts on, plus the absence of reloads on the side that must never reload.
// `KOS_SHELL_DIR` is passed exactly as the platform daemon passes it -- an
// absolute path to the session's Shell directory -- and the checkout is built
// here, one level up from it, because that is the layout the window derives the
