// The mask is MultiEffect, which is a shader, and that is a trade that was
// made deliberately: on the GPU session this runs in, the avatar is round; if
// the greeter ever comes up on a software renderer the shader paints nothing
// and the avatar is simply absent. It is decoration -- the name underneath it
// is plain text and cannot fail, and that is the part that has to survive.
//
// It is its own file for the same reason SessionMenu.qml is: an import that
// does not resolve inside the greeter takes down the file that declared it.
// Here the blast radius is one picture instead of the whole lock screen.
