# Does kscreenlocker actually pick this lock screen up?
#
# Runs apps/lockscreen/tests/theme-resolution/pkgprobe.cpp, which reproduces the
# greeter's own skin-selection logic (see the header of that file for the two
# conditions kscreenlocker 6.7.4 requires). It catches the two silent traps:
#
#   * the skin is loaded from a **Plasma/Shell** package named by
#     plasmashellrc [Shell] ShellPackage -- installing it as a Look-and-Feel
#     package, the obvious-looking place, has no effect on the lock screen;
#   * "X-Plasma-APIVersion" must be a TOP-LEVEL key of metadata.json, or the
#     greeter logs "Lockscreen QML outdated" and quietly loads KDE's own skin.
#
# Either mistake leaves you staring at the Breeze lock screen (its WallpaperFader
# blurs the wallpaper) while every config file says otherwise.
#
# Usage: ./run.sh [package-id]        (exit 0 = the greeter would load this theme)
