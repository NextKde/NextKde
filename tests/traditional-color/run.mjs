// Loads ColorScheme through the Kos.Ui alias under a real Quickshell, offscreen.
//
// The node suite (test_traditional_color.mjs) is authoritative for the colour
// maths. This fixture exists for the one thing Node cannot check: whether the
// QML engine can resolve the module graph ColorScheme.qml now pulls in —
// TraditionalColorScheme.mjs plus its Chinese/Japanese/Cam16Hct/Material
// dependencies. Those are relative imports resolved by QML's module system, so
// a file that is not where the QML side expects it is a load-time failure with
// no Node-visible symptom.
//
// Quickshell resolves "qs.desktop.modules.*" against the config directory, and
// the Kos/Ui alias inside shell/ points back into shared/qml by relative
// symlinks. Copying the tree would mean a second, drifting copy of the module
// layout, so the fixture symlinks shell/Kos into a scratch config instead and
// exercises the shipping files.
