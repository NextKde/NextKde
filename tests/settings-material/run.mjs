// Both are strings, and both fail *silently* when they are wrong -- a role name
// the palette does not carry resolves to undefined and falls back to the iPadOS
// literal (the window then claims to be Material while looking like macOS), and
// a control that is not handed an accent keeps its own iPadOS blue default.
//
// That is exactly what shipped: `role("surfaceContainerLow")` against a scheme
// that emits `surface_container_low`. Only the single-word roles resolved, so
// the sidebar, the selection and every text colour stayed iPadOS while the
// window reported `materialForm` correctly. This file is the tripwire for that
// class of mistake, and it has to run without Qt.
