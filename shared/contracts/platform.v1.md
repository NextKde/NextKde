# KOS platform IPC v1

The platform daemon listens on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kos-platform.sock`. The
socket is a per-user Unix socket with mode `0600`; it is not a network API.
Messages are UTF-8 JSON objects separated by newlines.

Every request contains `version`, `requestId`, `operation`, and an optional
`payload`. A response echoes `version` and `requestId`, and contains `ok` plus
either `result` or an `error` object. Long-lived subscriptions receive event
objects independently of request responses.

```json
{"version":1,"requestId":"42","operation":"platform.ping","payload":{}}
{"version":1,"requestId":"42","ok":true,"result":{"ready":true}}
```

Errors use stable machine-readable codes:

```json
{"version":1,"requestId":"42","ok":false,"error":{"code":"permission-denied","message":"操作被系统拒绝","retryable":true}}
```

Current operation groups are:

- `application.launch` (KDE-native desktop-entry launch; accepts a desktop ID
  and optional URLs, never an arbitrary command)
- `clipboard.set`, `clipboard.read`, `clipboard.save-image`,
  `clipboard.history.watch-images`,
  `clipboard.history.list`, `clipboard.history.copy`,
  `clipboard.history.delete`, `clipboard.history.clear`
- `input.clipboard-anchor` (`expectedWindowId`: original KWin window UUID;
  read once before mapping the clipboard panel). Returns `available`, `source`
  (`caret` or `pointer`), `x/y/width/height`, and
  `areaX/areaY/areaWidth/areaHeight` in global logical pixels. The effect uses
  enabled text-input-v3/v2 geometry only while the requested window owns both
  keyboard and text-input focus; otherwise it samples the current pointer.
  No surrounding text is accessed. The area excludes reserved panels on the
  selected output. Missing/older effects return `available: false`, preserving
  centered placement. Queries are asynchronous, uncached, and bounded to 150 ms.
- `input.paste` (`expectedWindowId`: KWin window UUID, required; the effect
  injects Ctrl+V only if that window still owns keyboard focus. Missing targets,
  changed focus and an older effect without the guarded method fail without
  injection. This is a desktop action, never a clipboard data operation.)
- `clipboard.thumb`, `clipboard.pinned.list`, `clipboard.pinned.add`,
  `clipboard.pinned.remove`, `clipboard.pinned.copy` (entry previews and a pin
  store under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/quickshell/<shell id>/clipboard`; every file is
  content-addressed and removed together with the entry that owns it, so
  deleting never leaves state behind)
- `file.open`, `file.copy`, `file.launch`, `file.rename`, `file.create-folder`,
  `file.create-file`, `file.transfer`, `file.trash`, `file.trash-state`,
  `file.empty-trash`, `file.open-trash`, `file.open-with`, `file.set-default`,
  `file.open-kde`
- `kwin.subscribe`, `kwin.command`, `kwin.layout.update`
- `kwin.animation.update-targets`, `kwin.animation.prepare-launch`
- `wallpaper.plasma.proxy` (replace every screen's Plasma wallpaper with a KOS
  backdrop package whose metadata carries the accent sampled from the Shell's
  wallpaper, so Plasma keeps painting a matching colour behind it; each
  screen's pre-takeover plugin and configuration are saved once, when the first
  takeover records them) and `wallpaper.plasma.restore` (put those wallpapers
  back per screen; `imagePath` is the fallback for screens the saved set does
  not cover). Non-image Plasma wallpapers -- Picture of the Day, slideshow,
  solid colour -- are stored as their plugin plus configuration, not as an
  image path.
- `wallpaper.preview.desktop` (KWin show-desktop; payload `{showing}`, result
  `{previous}`)
- `depth.generate` (CPU depth inference for an absolute local `imagePath`;
  set `prepareSpatial: true` to request optional scene assets;
  returns `{depthPath,width,height,cached,model,contract}` and, when scene
  preparation succeeds, `backgroundPath`, `mattePath`, `influencePath`, and
  `spatialContract`. Empty scene paths mean the depth-only renderer should be
  used. The optional worker
  downloads the pinned model to the user's cache on first use, verifies its
  SHA256, and keeps the ONNX session warm for up to one idle minute. Inference
  runs asynchronously and may take up to five minutes on the first request;
  worker failures are request-local and do not affect unrelated platform
  operations. Images remain local. This operation, the `spatial.*` group and
  the `spatial.resources` capability exist only when `KOS_BUILD_SPATIAL` resolved
  to a build: the worker is the one part of the daemon that links OpenCV and the
  ONNX Runtime, and a build without it reports `platform.ping` without that
  capability, which is what keeps the Shell's spatial wallpaper switched off.)
- `settings.open` (allow-listed KDE System Settings modules) and
  `settings.launch` (launch the `kos-settings` app with a fixed argv; the
  only accepted payload field is `shellDir`, an optional absolute path that
  must canonicalise to an existing directory and is exported to the child as
  `KOS_SHELL_DIR` so a development Settings session reconnects to the Shell
  that launched it; no caller-supplied arguments)
- `state.read`, `state.write` (bounded read/write of UTF-8 state files under
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/quickshell`; payload `{dir, file[, data]}` where `dir` is a
  relative sub-path -- or an absolute path that must stay under the state root
  -- and `file` is a bare file name (`dir` <=512 chars, `file` <=255 chars).
  Paths are canonicalized and must remain under the root (`..` and symlink
  escapes are rejected); payloads are capped at 1 MiB. `state.write` commits
  rename. `state.read` returns `{data, exists}` and reports `exists:false`
  with an empty `data` for a missing file)
- `notify` (freedesktop notification; payload `{summary, body?, icon?,
  appName?, urgency?}` with `urgency` one of `low`/`normal`/`critical` and
  `appName` (<=128 chars) the notification's grouping/app label, defaulting
  to `"KOS Shell"`. The daemon calls `org.freedesktop.Notifications.Notify`
  when the service is registered and otherwise spawns `notify-send` with a
  fixed argv; fields are length-capped and never reach a shell)
- `keepawake.get`, `keepawake.set` (KDE caffeine toggle; `set` requires a
  boolean `enabled`, returns `{available, enabled}`; `get` also returns
  `pending`). Availability requires PowerDevil and ScreenSaver. Both inhibitors
  must succeed before reporting enabled; partial failure rolls back. Each
  client socket owns a separate D-Bus connection and its inhibition cookies.
  Disabling, socket disconnect (including Shell reload/crash), daemon exit,
  or either KDE service changing owner releases the lease. State is transient
  and defaults to off after reconnect. The toggle does not intercept
  manual session actions or write power configuration.
- `nightlight.get`, `nightlight.toggle` (KWin Night Color; `toggle` writes
  `NightColor/Active` to kwinrc and applies through the NightLight D-Bus
  interface. Once the config write has committed, a failure to uninhibit /
  inhibit / reconfigure is partial application, not a failed toggle: the
  response stays `ok:true` with `result.applied:false` and a `warning`
  string, so callers align their UI to the persisted `enabled` state rather
  than rolling back to a value that no longer matches kwinrc)
- `shortcuts.apply`, `shortcuts.uninstall` (kglobalaccel-owned global
  shortcuts; the Shell composes each Exec line, the daemon validates,
  persists, and registers)
- `tray.identify` (friendly names for StatusNotifierItem entries whose `Id` is
  a generated token such as an Electron `chrome_status_icon_*`; the daemon
  reads the SNI watcher's registration list, each item's `Id`/`Title`, and the
  owning connection's PID -- then `/proc/<pid>/comm` and `cmdline` -- on its
  worker pool, so the Shell never spawns a helper process to resolve them.
  Returns `{"names": {"<itemId>": "<friendly name>"}}`; an item whose name
  cannot be derived is omitted rather than mapped to an empty string, and the
  Shell keeps its own fallback for those)
- `network.*` (including `network.traffic` for read-only interface counters),
  `audio.*` (including `audio.applications`,
  `audio.application.set-volume`, and `audio.application.set-mute` for
  per-application PipeWire/PulseAudio sink-input control), `bluetooth.*`, `display.*`, `session.*`,
  `theme.*`, and `screenshot.*`

`network.details {device}` includes `macAddress` from NetworkManager's device
properties alongside `ipv4`, `ssid`, `connectionName` and `signalStrength`.
An unavailable hardware address is an empty string. `network.traffic` counters
are interface lifetime bytes, not per-process totals; a UI may subtract a local
reset baseline without changing the counters or network configuration.

KWin events are sent to subscribers as `window.snapshot`, `desktops`,
`thumbnail`, `animation.started`, and related event names. KWin's internal script-to-daemon channel
continues to use the session D-Bus service `org.kos.Platform` at `/Platform`;
clients must not call that private interface directly.

`kwin.layout.update` is an internal Shell-to-compositor layout update. Its
payload is
`{outputName, outputRect, barReservedHeight, dockPosition, dockRect, workspaceGap}`.
Rectangles use global logical coordinates; `dockPosition` is one of `bottom`,
`left`, or `right`. The daemon bounds and validates every field before
forwarding an `update-layout` command to the KWin script. A new normal main
window may use the latest layout for its one-time initial placement; existing,
maximized, fullscreen, dialog, transient, and special windows are not moved.
`workspaceGap` remains accepted for v1 compatibility, but initial placement
meets the Bar/Dock safe edges directly and does not create an invisible gap.

On `kwin.subscribe`, the daemon replays both its latest `window.snapshot` and
latest `desktops` event when available. Consumers may explicitly request a
fresh desktop event with `kwin.command {action: "desktops"}` during startup.

Platform adapters validate all paths and operation names before executing a
system action. Existing paths are canonicalized and new targets are resolved
through a canonical existing parent. Passwords and raw command output
containing secrets must never be logged.

Global shortcuts are registered by the platform daemon through the
KGlobalAccel client library (the plasma powerdevil mechanism): every KOS
shortcut is a QAction under the single `org.kos.Platform` component, so the
Shortcuts KCM shows ONE "KOS" entry and no service desktop files exist at
all. `shortcuts.apply` carries `{shortcuts:[{id,description,combo,exec}]}`;
the daemon allow-lists each exec — it must parse (shell quoting rules, no
metacharacters) into `qs|quickshell [-c name] [-p|--path dir] ipc call
<target> <action>...` and is spawned as an argv array, never through a
shell; anything else is rejected and logged. On activation the daemon runs
the validated command the Shell supplied, so it always addresses the live
Shell instance (dev `-p` or installed `-c kos`).
`shortcuts.uninstall` unregisters the actions and removes leftover files
from superseded layouts.

`kwin.animation.*` accepts a JSON string payload produced by the Dock animation
model and forwards it only to the project-owned KWin effect. `theme.apply-system`,
`theme.sync-glass`, and `theme.sync-dock-animation` accept bounded values and
own the KDE configuration writes; Shell and Settings never invoke `qdbus6` or
`kwriteconfig6`. `theme.apply-system` and `theme.toggle` change only the KDE
color scheme when that tool is available; applying a complete Look-and-Feel
package is a compatibility fallback, because replacing icons and workspace
defaults is outside the light/dark toggle contract.

`theme.sync-dock-animation` accepts `{style:"scale"|"genie"}` as a legacy
appearance preference. It preserves an explicit window-page choice. A legacy
`genie` without a saved choice migrates to KWin Magic Lamp, with
`HideAnimationSelection=genie` and `HideAnimation=none`. The shared
`platform/src/windowanimation/NativeGenie.h` adapter checks support, manages
Magic Lamp/Squash exclusivity, and preserves previous plugin-key values and
presence for restoration when the user chooses None. Missing/unsupported or
load-failed Genie retains the selected `genie` preference and configures
`HideAnimation=scale` with a `NativeGenieFallback` reason. Saved Genie is
rechecked on startup, so support returning recovers the native backend. Explicit
None is not migrated. Failed exclusivity/project-effect changes restore both
configuration and runtime state; rollback failure is reported explicitly.

### Audio output selection

- `audio.outputs` takes `{}` and returns `{available: true, outputs: [{name,
  description, isDefault}]}`. The daemon reads PulseAudio-compatible `pactl`
  JSON (including PipeWire-Pulse); names are stable sink names, not PipeWire
  numeric node IDs. Missing tools/server or malformed replies return an error.
- `audio.output.set-default` takes `{name}` and sets the default sink through
  `pactl set-default-sink`. An unavailable/removed sink returns an error; the
  client re-reads the outputs and default volume after completion. Routing of
  streams explicitly pinned to a device remains owned by the audio server.
- The visible output list refreshes while the control centre is open, including
  device hotplug. Errors remain visible with a click-to-retry action.

`file.launch` and `file.open-kde` use the same KDE `KIO::ApplicationLauncherJob`
launcher as `application.launch`. A desktop-file path is resolved and parsed by
`KService`; optional file arguments are passed as URLs. Launch failure is
reported through the common response envelope.

### Status panel operations

- `network.applications` (read): returns `{scope: "user-tcp", sockets: [{id, name, pid, rxBytes, txBytes}]}` from `ss -tinpeOH`. Visible-owner TCP counters are sampled per socket before grouping by process name. Local proxy connections may count the same traffic twice. UDP/QUIC, inaccessible owners, and connections closed between samples are excluded. These totals are independent of interface totals.
- `power.profiles` (read): returns `{profiles, activeProfile, degraded}`.
  When `powerprofilesctl` is on `PATH`, the daemon runs `powerprofilesctl list`
  and parses its text. If absent or unable to start (not a nonzero exit), it reads the system D-Bus PowerProfiles
  service, trying `org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfiles` at
  `/org/freedesktop/UPower/PowerProfiles` and then `net.hadess.PowerProfiles`
  at `/net/hadess/PowerProfiles`. `Profiles`, `ActiveProfile` and
  `PerformanceDegraded` are read with `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get`.
  Only `power-saver`, `balanced` and `performance` are returned.
  `PerformanceDegraded` of `no` or an empty string becomes an empty
  `degraded`. If the helper is missing and neither name answers, the
  operation fails with `command-unavailable`.
- `power.battery` (read): takes `{}` and returns `{available, complete, batteries, adapters}`
  from bounded reads of `/sys/class/power_supply/*/uevent` (at most 64 devices,
  16 KiB each). `complete` is false if enumeration is unavailable, exceeds the
  device limit, or any device read fails, is empty/oversized, or lacks a type.
  Incomplete samples must not be used for whole-system battery aggregation or
  pack-specific fields; the Shell falls back to UPower capacity/health instead.
  All online adapter nodes are displayed separately, including nodes without
  telemetry. No helper, system mutation, or caller-supplied path. `batteries`
  contains present system packs with `name`, `model` and optional `energyFullWh`,
  `energyDesignWh`, `chargeFullMah`, `chargeDesignMah`, `powerWatts`, `currentMa`,
  `voltage`, `cycles`, `temperature` (°C). Charge-based energy conversion uses
  design voltage. `adapters` contains online Mains/USB supplies with `name` and
  optional `powerWatts`, `ratedPowerWatts`, `currentMa`, `voltage`. Missing or
  invalid attributes are omitted; zero is a valid measured value. Adapter power
  is never inferred from battery power. The Shell reads on open and every ten
  seconds while open, drops stale replies after close/disconnect, and otherwise
  continues using UPower's event-driven charge/state/time/health data. Multiple
  battery capacities are combined in Wh only; pack-specific voltage, current,
  cycle and temperature fields are unavailable for a combined display.
- `power.profile.set` (write): accepts `{profile: "power-saver" | "balanced" | "performance"}`.
  The same helper-or-D-Bus choice applies. A D-Bus write sets `ActiveProfile`
  with `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set` on the service that answered the
  read. Reads and writes are asynchronous on both clients, with whole-operation
  deadlines of 2s for reads and 12s for writes (including discovery). No second
  endpoint lookup occurs before Set. System authorization is retained. A helper or D-Bus failure is
  `command-failed`. Success is followed by a readback before the client
  confirms the selected profile.

The optional `ss` helper must be installed for application traffic. Power
profiles use `powerprofilesctl` when it is on `PATH`, and the PowerProfiles
D-Bus API otherwise. Fedora's `tuned-ppd` owns both bus names and does not
ship the helper, so that installation takes the D-Bus path. Missing both the
helper and the service reports an unavailable state. Battery telemetry needs
neither helper; an unavailable or older platform daemon leaves extra metrics
as `—` while UPower charge/state, available capacity, time and health continue
to update. The independent Power settings page uses the same helper-or-D-Bus
choice and observes system D-Bus profile changes on both names; it is
available without a battery or running shell.
