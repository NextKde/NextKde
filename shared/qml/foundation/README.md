# Foundation

Portable Qt Quick foundations for standalone applications. The components in
this directory are built as the static `Kos.Ui` QML module and must not import
Quickshell, KWin, or Wayland-specific APIs.

The module provides the application window, semantic palette and material
surfaces, cards, empty states, navigation controls, rounded buttons, switch,
slider, segmented control, text field, and the common application settings
dialog. KDE compositor integration belongs to the independent applications'
runtime (see [application ownership](../../../apps/README.md)); when native blur
is unavailable these portable QML surfaces automatically use a high-opacity
fallback.

`KosKineticScroll` centralizes scrolling policy for Flickable, ListView,
GridView and ScrollView. Applications do not need device detection, motion
constants or layout-parent workarounds. It preserves Ctrl gestures, nested
views and `AppTheme.reduceMotion`.

```qml
ListView {
    KosKineticScroll {} // Automatically finds and attaches to this view.
}
// For a ScrollView, declare alongside it or as a separate object property:
ScrollView { id: page; /* content */ }
KosKineticScroll { target: page }
```

Attach one instance per view. Existing explicit `flickable: view` usage remains
supported. The component owns placement, respects visibility/enabled state,
includes originX/originY in bounds, and restores ScrollView's original wheel
handling when disabled or destroyed. Dragging, hidden/disabled state and device switches cancel motion. Angle
animation also yields to external position changes.

Angle input preserves 72px/notch, averages the recent 80ms of input and adds
at most 72px of coast (900px/s cap, 6000px/s² deceleration). A critically
damped follow settles a lone notch in about 200ms. Continuous input uses
native NumberAnimation with OutCubic easing and 50–200ms duration scaled by
remaining distance. Tiny moves up to 2px are immediate. It accumulates the
requested endpoint without writing content position once per input event.
Like Kirigami on Wayland, angle deltas take priority when both channels exist;
pixel-only input retains its exact distance. Fine angle-only streams also
use native smoothing, covering touchpads without usable pixel deltas.
Event-gap speed amplification is
removed. Both paths stop at hard boundaries without rebound.

Qt Quick's QML WheelEvent does not expose scroll phases. Pixel streams may
already include system momentum, so this component never synthesizes another
coast after them. Coarse angle-only notches use the bounded-inertia path.
These are KOS tuning defaults inspired by Kirigami's bounded scrolling,
not universal optimal values. Wheel motion uses FrameAnimation and stops
while hidden, disabled or settled. Continuous motion uses Qt's native
property animation driver without JavaScript stepping each frame.

The arithmetic lives in `KosKineticScrollPhysics.mjs` with pure Node tests.
QML regression tests cover both input paths, automatic placement, ScrollView,
sliders, nested views, device switching and reduced motion. The current app
integration still leaves menus, Dock previews, calendar, wallpaper strip and
legacy music on their existing paths. ListenFree is not changed.
